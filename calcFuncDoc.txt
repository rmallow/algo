Change to be implemented for actions is a require configuration:
if event a requires a calculation based on event b, a require config can be included with event a
this would force event b to be included even if it was not listed in the master configuration that was loaded in
assume that this convetion will be included in the future, it will be added at some point


TO ADD:
Math:

    *Note: many functions will use sma or ema, maybe have that as a kwarg in future?*
SMA - simple moving average
EMA - exponential moving average
standard deviation:
    have two different versions one using sma and another using ema




Finance:
RSI
MACD (ask me about this one if i don't add clarification here)
MFI
On-Balance Volume (OBV)
average true range

Other:
max/min of period
    example:
    period: 3
    data: [0, 1, 4, 5, 3, 4]
    calcMin: [0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 3, 3]
    calcMax: [0, 1, 4, 5, 5, 5]

times so far stock value has moved 1% or more
