Calculation Function Standards
Date: 6/25/20
Last Updated: 6/25/20

Documentation for each fucntion needs to go directly above the funciton and in an external document

Comment blcoks above each py function that can be used as a calc func (not helper formulas)
These comment blocks need to follow a specific standard to work with later implementation
This documentation needs to define the output dict, listing the columns and what values each column will contain

--- Example ---

eventFuncs.py:

"""
Description: Returns the RSI using a 14 time period SMA
Output:
    rsi : array
"""
def rsi-sma-14(feed):
    ...
    return {"rsi":array}

calcFuncDoc.txt:

func : rsi-sma-14
description: returns the RSI using a 14 time period SMA
output:
    rsi : array

func: ...

--- End Example ---

Extra ouput codes:
For values in which there isn't enough data to calculate it: "insufData"
