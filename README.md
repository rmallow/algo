# algo
By Robert Mallow

A custom data processing system, created with the intent of algorithmic trading.

This data processing system is intended to be highly scalable and highly customizable.
Users can create their own simple functions and use them directly.

Input and output is handled asynchronously while calcuations are handled with multi processing to be as fast as possible.
As you increase the amount of data processing intended for algo, then algo will continue to attempt to scale up to accomodate.
